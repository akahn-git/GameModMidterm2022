Quake 4

This mod allows the player to become pac man and navigate through his maze collecting points 

I added a points system for the player and changed the ammo pickups to become differnet pac man collectible items.

To test the setup of the pacman level type pacman into the command line and you will be teleported into the pacman level
To test the pellets, fruit, and power pellets, you can collect a shotgun ammo and recieve 10 points, collect fruit and get 100 points, or collect the power pellets and recieve 50 points and the ability to kill the enemies

The camera does not work
The player movement is not locked along the axis
The ghosts do not behave like they do in the original pac man
